# License Plate detection and extraction with YOLO and PaddleOCR

This project implements a YOLOv11 trained model to detect vehicle license plates. Then, with PaddleOCR and a specific preprocessing programmed the vehicle registration is extracted from the license plate. The project also provides the option
to make de detection and extraction from an image or in real time with a functional camera.
